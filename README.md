## Diabetics Mellitus Classification Analysis using AWS SageMaker

## Overview:
Implemented a machine learning project to classify Diabetes Mellitus using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on AWS SageMaker. The project involved data preparation, model training, evaluation, deployment, and hosting the model's Jupyter Notebook as a static webpage on AWS S3.

## Key Responsibilities:

- `AWS Account Setup:` Created an AWS account and navigated the AWS Management Console to access SageMaker.
- *SageMaker Notebook Instance:* Launched and configured a SageMaker notebook instance to develop and execute the machine learning code.
- *Data Preparation:* Uploaded and preprocessed the Diabetes Mellitus dataset, performing data cleaning, transformation, and normalization.
- *Model Training:* Developed and trained the SVM model using the prepared dataset, then evaluated its performance on validation data.
- *Model Deployment:* Deployed the trained model as a web service on SageMaker and tested its accuracy and performance on unseen data.
- *Web Hosting:* Hosted the Jupyter Notebook as a static webpage on AWS S3, configuring bucket properties and permissions for public access.
- *Webpage Testing:* Ensured the static webpage was functioning correctly, with the SVM model providing accurate predictions based on user inputs.

## Outcome:
Successfully deployed a Diabetes Mellitus classification model on AWS, demonstrating the ability to leverage cloud platforms for scalable machine learning solutions and making the model accessible through a web interface.
